## A little bit of history

The code apart from the Kokx module has a lot of history for me.
I've been writing PHP since 2008/2009 in my spare time. 
Most of it I learned on my own, school didn't learn me much, only a few basic principles.
Why didn't I start using libraries ?
Ignorance and wanting write my own code are the most important reasons.
The code still improves bit by bit with every little project I do, but it still has a long way to go.
I could go on for hours about it, but I'm gonna stop here.
You can always query me if you'd like to know more.

Now a little bit about the kokx converter / OGame part in the story.
I also started playing OGame in 2009 at ogame.org (played it in 2005 only for a few weeks).
As a lot of players I wanted to post my combat reports on the boards.
I started using the Kokx converter when I joined the Dutch community.
I loved the way it looked and kept using it.
Sadly because of new OGame versions and Kokx stopping development, it didn't work well anymore.
That's when I offered my help to start updating and fixing the code.
After a few updates and not knowing the Zend framework (used in the original code), I decided to start using my own little "framework" and simplifying existing code.
And that's where the code is now.
